
## Implementation Steps

### 1. Setup Chrome Extension Structure
- Create the basic extension structure with manifest.json
- Configure permissions for X.com domain access
- Set up background and content scripts
- Design a simple popup interface

### 2. Image Scraping Implementation
- Develop content script to identify and extract images from X.com
- Create observers to detect new images as they appear during scrolling
- Implement filtering to avoid processing duplicate images
- Add functionality to extract image URLs and metadata

### 3. LLM API Integration
- Set up connection to a Meta model API (like Llama 2 or similar)
- Create functions to send images to the API for analysis
- Implement prompt engineering to accurately identify Studio Ghibli style
- Handle API responses and error conditions

### 4. Image Processing and Storage
- Develop logic to process API responses (true/false for Ghibli style)
- Create image download functionality for positively identified images
- Implement local storage management for downloaded images
- Add options for customizing save locations and file naming

### 5. User Interface and Settings
- Design an intuitive popup interface
- Add toggle for enabling/disabling the extension
- Implement statistics tracking (images processed, downloaded)
- Create settings for API key management and download preferences

### 6. Testing and Optimization
- Test on various X.com layouts and scenarios
- Optimize image detection for performance

### 7. Packaging and Distribution
- Package the extension for Chrome Web Store
- Implement update mechanism

## Technical Considerations
- Use MutationObserver to detect dynamically loaded images
- Consider using chrome local storage for caching processed images
- Ensure proper error handling for network issues
- Implement privacy-focused design (only process images, no text content)

## API Integration Details
- Use a vision-capable LLM model (e.g., GPT-4 Vision, Llama 2 with vision capabilities)
- Craft a specific sytem prompt like: "Is this image in Studio Ghibli art style? Answer only with true or false."
- Consider implementing a confidence threshold for more accurate results
